# Dynamic Price Prediction in E-commerce Website

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a dynamic price prediction model for an e-commerce website. The goal is to predict the price of products based on various influencing factors such as demand, product category, time of day, seasonal trends, and promotions. The system uses machine learning algorithms to make price predictions in real-time, helping businesses optimize their pricing strategy and maximize profit.

## Features

- **Price Prediction Model**: Predicts product prices based on historical data.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Updates prices based on current market factors (e.g., demand, promotions).
- **Web Interface**: A simple web interface to input product details and display predicted prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation and preprocessing
  - `numpy` - Numerical computing
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning model training
  - `flask` - Web framework for deploying the model
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` - Data visualization
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Web Deployment**: Flask for creating a web interface (Optional)
- **Data Sources**: E-commerce product data (scraped or sourced from Kaggle)
